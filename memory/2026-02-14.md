# 2026‑02‑14 – Piston Kinematic Simulation & Training Continuation

**Time:** 01:14 SGT Saturday, February 14, 2026

## Piston Kinematic Simulation

**User instruction:** "hi, please continue with training, to check you can try simulating the piston's movement and see if the geometry holds"

**Action taken:** Created `piston_kinematic_simulation.py` – analytical simulation of piston, conrod, crankshaft kinematics through full 360° crank rotation.

### Parameters
- Crank radius: 23.75 mm (stroke 47.5 mm)
- Conrod length: 150.0 mm (rod ratio = 1.58)
- Bore: 94.5 mm, piston radial clearance: 0.05 mm
- Compression height: 38.0 mm, skirt length: 56.99 mm
- Deck clearance: 0.8 mm (target)

### Results
1. **Deck clearance at TDC:** 0.800 mm ✅ (matches target)
2. **Skirt‑crankcase clearance:** 234.1 mm ✅ (ample)
3. **Maximum conrod angularity:** 9.11° ✅ (within typical <20° limit)
4. **Conrod‑crankcase clearance (assumed):** 52.1 mm ✅ (beam likely clears crankcase)
5. **Ring belt travel:** ⚠️ warning – cylinder liner length undefined; ring belt may exceed liner bounds if liner too short.
6. **Piston acceleration:** 27.5 mm/s² per rad²/s² (normalized)

### Key Findings
- Basic kinematic geometry **holds** – no major interferences detected in simplified model.
- Conrod beam is centered on cylinder axis at BDC (distance = 0), but crankcase assumed radius provides ample clearance.
- Need to define cylinder liner length to verify ring belt stays within liner.
- Actual interference checks require CAD boolean operations at critical angles (TDC, 90°, BDC).

### Recommendations
- Perform CAD interference check with actual geometry (piston, conrod, crankshaft, block).
- Validate side‑thrust and piston tilt (dynamic simulation).
- Check valve‑to‑piston clearance with valve lift profiles (requires cylinder head model).

## Ongoing Issues

### Conrod Step‑wise Correction (Loft Error)
- Script `conrod_stepwise_corrected.py` halted at Step 2 due to CadQuery loft expecting a face, but profile creation returns a wire.
- **Root cause:** `make_I_section_profile()` returns closed wire; need to convert to face before loft.
- **Pending fix:** After machine restart, correct geometry type validation and continue step‑wise construction.

### Crankshaft Validation Checklist
- Checklist created (`CRANKSHAFT_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`) identifying 8 critical errors (cheek interference, missing oil passages, etc.).
- Corrections not yet applied to CAD.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Fix conrod step‑wise script (convert wire to face, complete loft).
2. Apply corrections to crankshaft CAD (curved cheeks, oil passages, fillets).
3. Define cylinder liner length and verify ring belt containment.

### Medium‑term
4. Perform CAD interference check across full crank cycle (automated positioning + boolean).
5. Extend validation to cylinder block and cylinder head.
6. Implement self‑iteration loop: detect geometric errors → adjust parameters → regenerate CAD.

## Notes
- Kinematic simulation is a **necessary but insufficient** validation – must be followed by CAD interference checking.
- The training loop is progressing: able to create validation checklists, identify errors, implement corrections (piston ring grooves, conrod bearing shells), and now perform kinematic simulation.
- GitHub repository updated with simulation script and results.

**Status:** Training continues; geometry holds kinematically; pending CAD‑level verification.
