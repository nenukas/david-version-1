  - 109 total solids
  - Bounding box: 2035 × 1125 × 535 mm
  - Estimated engine components: 99, plumbing segments: 26
  - Bounding‑box intersections detected (expected due to bolts, overlaps)
- **GitHub updated** (commit `6d9020f`)
  - Added assembly & plumbing CAD files
  - Added assembly scripts (`assembly_plumbing_simple.py`, `pipe_utils_v2.py`)
  - Updated `README_V12_30MPa.md`

### Issues Resolved
- **Plumbing geometry**: Sweep failed for complex paths; used simple cylinders instead.
- **Compound creation**: Fixed by extracting Solid objects from Workplane, using `Compound.makeCompound`.
- **Segmentation fault**: Earlier version crashed; simplified approach succeeded.

### Next Steps
1. **Ansys coupled thermo‑mechanical FEA** on `single_cylinder_assembly_v2.step`
2. **CFD of sidepod airflow** for intercooler heat transfer
3. **Fabricate prototype intercooler core** (machined aluminum)
4. **Source real components** (York 210 compressor, Garrett turbos)
5. **Dyno testing** with instrumentation

## CAD Protocol Development & Conrod Correction

**CAD Protocol** created () with step‑by‑step methodology for manufacturing‑ready geometry.
**Issue identified:** Conrod bearing dimensions mismatched with crankshaft/piston:
-  optimized to 86.5 mm (should be 61.415 mm)
-  116.8 mm > crank‑pin axial space (26.5 mm)
-  61.8 mm (should be 28.0 mm)

**Correction applied:** Fixed bearing interfaces, kept optimized beam geometry.
**Result:**  generated with:
- Big‑end: Ø61.475 × 22.522 mm (fits between crank cheeks)
- Small‑end: Ø28.060 × 32.500 mm (bearing pressure 197 MPa)
- All constraints satisfied, mass 0.288 kg.
**Commit:**  pushed to GitHub.
**Next:** Visual inspection, then piston/crankshaft CAD alignment.

## CAD Protocol & Corrected Components (Afternoon)

**CAD Protocol** developed (`CAD_PROTOCOL.md`) – step‑by‑step methodology for manufacturing‑ready geometry.

**Identified critical mismatch:** Conrod bearing diameters/widths incorrectly optimized vs actual crank/piston pins.

**Corrected conrod:**
- Big‑end: Ø61.475 × 22.522 mm (crank‑pin Ø61.415 mm + 0.03 mm clearance)
- Small‑end: Ø28.060 × 32.500 mm (piston‑pin Ø28.0 mm + 0.03 mm clearance)
- Beam geometry unchanged from optimization (50 × 30.2 mm I‑beam)
- All constraints satisfied, mass 0.288 kg

**Generated CAD files:**
- `final_corrected_conrod.step`
- `final_piston.step` (crown 15 mm)
- `final_crankshaft_throw.step`
- `single_cylinder_assembly_corrected.step`

**Clearances validated:** piston‑bore 0.05 mm, conrod‑crank axial 2.0 mm, radial 0.03 mm.

**Commit:** `484d0f2` pushed with all scripts.

**Awaiting visual feedback** before adding fillets, threads, and manufacturing details.

## CAD Error Correction & Validation Protocol (Afternoon–Evening)

**User feedback:** Piston CAD incorrect – cylinder and cuboid intersecting wrongly.

**Root cause:** ring_land cylinder (solid) intersected pin‑boss cuboids (47,558 mm³ each side).  
**Design flaw:** separate solids (crown, ring_land, skirt) unioned without checking interference.

**Actions taken:**

1. **Created validation module** `cad_validation_new.py`:
   - Volume, bounding‑box checks
   - Interference detection (solids intersecting when they shouldn't)
   - Connection detection (solids disjoint when they should connect)
   - Stepwise builder with intermediate STEP exports

2. **Generated corrected piston** `piston_simple_correct.step`:
   - Single solid cylinder (no separate parts)
   - Integral boss protrusions
   - No erroneous intersections
   - Volume 525,927 mm³, skirt wall 4.2 mm

3. **Updated protocol:** math first → step‑wise construction → validation each step → self‑iteration if fails.

**Next:** apply same validation to conrod, crankshaft, assembly.

## Coordinate System Corrections & Final Assembly

**Conrod** – corrected coordinate system: big‑end center X=0, small‑end X=150 mm, beam connecting them. Volume 171,112 mm³.

**Crankshaft** – corrected: main journal at (0,0,0), pin at (0,0,-23.75 mm). Cheek interference due to journal/pin diameters > stroke (design constraint). Volume 193,072 mm³.

**Piston** – simple solid cylinder, volume 525,927 mm³.

**Single‑cylinder assembly** created with kinematic positioning (crank center Z=89.05 mm, deck clearance 0.8 mm). All components aligned.

**Remaining issue:** Crankshaft journal/pin diameters exceed stroke → cheek cannot fit without overlap. Need to adjust optimization bounds or accept overlapping cheek (actual cheek would be curved, not rectangular).

**Commit:** `10bd583` with corrected scripts.

## Engine Design Learning & Realistic Models

**Research conducted:**
- Studied piston design from GrabCAD tutorial: ring lands, crown dome, skirt, pin bosses, internal cavity.
- Studied connecting rod design: I‑beam cross‑section, big‑end cap with bolts, small‑end bushing.
- Differences between motorcycle and car engines: higher RPM, slipper pistons, port design, cylinder barrels, vibration management.

**Created realistic models:**
- `piston_realistic.step` – 3 ring grooves, pin bosses, skirt arc, internal cavity. Compression height 38 mm.
- `conrod_realistic.step` – I‑beam shaft, big‑end with split cap, bolt holes.

**Key realization:** Previous "generative design" was simplistic geometric shapes missing functional features (ring grooves, bolt holes, bearing surfaces). Real design requires understanding of manufacturing constraints and functional requirements.

**Self‑validation capability developed:** Created comprehensive checklists for piston and connecting rod design based on SAE standards and engineering principles.

**Identified critical errors in current models:**

**Piston (`piston_realistic.step`):**
1. Ring groove depth incorrect (2 mm vs SAE D‑wall = bore/22 = 4.3 mm)
2. No oil drain holes behind oil ring
3. Missing chamfers/fillets (stress concentrations)
4. Simplified skirt (no barrel shape or cam‑ground profile)
5. No valve reliefs for 4‑valve head
6. No draft angles for manufacturing
7. Pin boss transitions sharp
8. Thermal expansion not considered

**Connecting rod (`conrod_realistic.step`):**
1. **Rod ratio unrealistic** – 6.32 vs typical 1.5‑2.2 (likely optimization error)
2. No beam taper (inefficient structural design)
3. Bolt spacing excessive (80 mm vs typical 30‑40 mm)
4. No bearing bushes/shells (solid material instead of replaceable)
5. No lubrication passages
6. No draft angles for forging
7. Sharp transitions at beam‑end junctions
8. No proper cap features (simplified split)

**Root cause:** Optimization constraints likely incorrect, leading to unrealistic rod length (150 mm) for stroke (47.5 mm).

**Next step:** Await user direction – fix piston errors, investigate rod ratio issue, or continue validation for crankshaft.
