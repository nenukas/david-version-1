# 2026‑02‑12 – DAVID Project Start

## Context
- **09:31 SGT:** User requested engineering assistant (JARVIS‑like) capable of simulations, generative designs, and CAD for complex systems.
- **Primary goal:** Build a working sports car/hypercar as first project.
- **Parallel project:** AutoLeads SG continues running in background (cron jobs for outreach/enrichment).
- **Repository:** `david‑version‑1` created locally; pending push to GitHub.

## Initial Setup
- Created folder structure: `docs/`, `src/`, `simulations/`, `cad/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `memory/`.
- Wrote `README.md` with project vision, phases, and toolchain.
- Created `MEMORY.md` for long‑term decision tracking.

## Generative Design Progress (10:05 SGT)
- **Engine specifications finalized:** 8.0 L V12 twin‑charged, dual‑mode (Euro‑6 standard / 3000 WHP overdrive).
- **Toolchain installed:** `pyOpt`, `OpenMDAO`, `DEAP`, `CadQuery` (parametric CAD).
- **Crankshaft generative design completed:**
  - Analytical model with stress, stiffness, mass calculations.
  - Parametric CAD generation (STEP/STL export).
  - Evolutionary optimization (DEAP) with 30‑population × 20‑generations.
  - **Optimal design:** 13.03 kg mass, all constraints satisfied (shear, bending, torsional stiffness).
  - CAD files: `crankshaft_baseline.step`, `crankshaft_optimized.step`.
- **Code committed** to GitHub ([nenukas/david‑version‑1](https://github.com/nenukas/david-version-1)).

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Create GitHub repository** (`nenukas/david‑version‑1`) and push initial commit. ✅ **Done**
2. **Install core dependencies:** Python environment with `pyOpt`, `FreeCAD` API, `Calculix`, `OpenFOAM` (if needed). ✅ **Partial (missing Calculix)**
3. **Define hypercar specifications:** Performance targets, constraints, regulatory compliance (Singapore?). ✅ **Done**
4. **Start generative design loop:** Simple component (e.g., suspension upright) as proof‑of‑concept. ✅ **Done (crankshaft)**

## Next Components
1. **FEA validation** of optimized crankshaft using Calculix.
2. **Generative design of connecting rod** (titanium, buckling + fatigue).
3. **Generative design of piston** (forged aluminum, thermal + mechanical).
4. **Generative design of cylinder block** (CGI iron, additive‑friendly features).

## Questions for User
1. **Performance targets:** What are the key numbers? (0–100 km/h, top speed, range, lap time reference)
2. **Powertrain:** Internal combustion, hybrid, or full electric?
3. **Budget/constraints:** Any cost targets, material restrictions, manufacturing method (CNC, 3D printing, composite)?
4. **Regulatory:** Need to meet any specific standards (FMVSS, EU, Singapore LTA)?
5. **Timeline:** Expected milestone dates?

## Notes
- AutoLeads enrichment runs at 2pm SGT; outreach at 9am tomorrow.
- Engineering assistant will use same OpenClaw session but separate memory to avoid token overflow.
