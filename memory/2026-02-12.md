# 2026‑02‑12 – DAVID Project Start

## Context
- **09:31 SGT:** User requested engineering assistant (JARVIS‑like) capable of simulations, generative designs, and CAD for complex systems.
- **Primary goal:** Build a working sports car/hypercar as first project.
- **Parallel project:** AutoLeads SG continues running in background (cron jobs for outreach/enrichment).
- **Repository:** `david‑version‑1` created locally; pending push to GitHub.

## Initial Setup
- Created folder structure: `docs/`, `src/`, `simulations/`, `cad/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `memory/`.
- Wrote `README.md` with project vision, phases, and toolchain.
- Created `MEMORY.md` for long‑term decision tracking.

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Create GitHub repository** (`nenukas/david‑version‑1`) and push initial commit.
2. **Install core dependencies:** Python environment with `pyOpt`, `FreeCAD` API, `Calculix`, `OpenFOAM` (if needed).
3. **Define hypercar specifications:** Performance targets, constraints, regulatory compliance (Singapore?).
4. **Start generative design loop:** Simple component (e.g., suspension upright) as proof‑of‑concept.

## Questions for User
1. **Performance targets:** What are the key numbers? (0–100 km/h, top speed, range, lap time reference)
2. **Powertrain:** Internal combustion, hybrid, or full electric?
3. **Budget/constraints:** Any cost targets, material restrictions, manufacturing method (CNC, 3D printing, composite)?
4. **Regulatory:** Need to meet any specific standards (FMVSS, EU, Singapore LTA)?
5. **Timeline:** Expected milestone dates?

## Notes
- AutoLeads enrichment runs at 2pm SGT; outreach at 9am tomorrow.
- Engineering assistant will use same OpenClaw session but separate memory to avoid token overflow.
