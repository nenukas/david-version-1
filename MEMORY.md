# MEMORY.md – DAVID Engineering Assistant

## Project Identity
- **Name:** DAVID (Design Assistant for Vehicle Innovation & Development)
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Created:** 2026‑02‑12 09:31 SGT
- **Primary Goal:** Design, simulate, and produce CAD for a working sports car/hypercar.
- **Secondary Goal:** Evolve into a general‑purpose engineering assistant (JARVIS‑like).

## Core Principles
1. **Generative‑first:** Use optimization algorithms to explore design spaces.
2. **Simulation‑driven:** Validate every design with physics‑based simulation.
3. **Modular architecture:** Each subsystem (suspension, powertrain, aerodynamics) is independently modeled and tested.
4. **Open‑source toolchain:** Prefer FreeCAD, Calculix, OpenFOAM, Modelica.
5. **Real‑time interaction:** Voice/chat control, live dashboards, progressive disclosure.

## Key Decisions
*To be filled as project progresses.*

## Technical Stack
*To be populated after environment setup.*

## Milestones
- [ ] Environment setup (Python env, CAD tools, simulation solvers)
- [ ] Conceptual design: target specifications & constraints
- [ ] Generative design of first component (e.g., suspension upright)
- [ ] FEA validation of component
- [ ] CFD of external aerodynamics
- [ ] Full vehicle CAD assembly
- [ ] Multibody dynamics simulation (lap time prediction)
- [ ] Manufacturing‑ready drawings & BOM

## Notes
*Daily logs are stored in `memory/YYYY‑MM‑DD.md`.*
