 CYLINDER BLOCK THERMAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY (V12, 3000 whp, 30 MPa)
============================================================================

1. OPTIMIZED DESIGN (7075‑T6 BILLET ALUMINUM)
   • Bore diameter: 94.5 mm
   • Bore spacing: 144.7 mm
   • Cylinder wall thickness: 4.87 mm
   • Water‑jacket thickness: 7.79 mm
   • Deck thickness (original): 10.17 mm
   • Deck thickness (updated): 12.00 mm
   • Mass (original): 20.06 kg
   • Mass (updated): ≈20.71 kg (+0.65 kg)

2. PRESSURE‑ONLY STRESSES (30 MPa PEAK)
   • Hoop stress (cylinder wall): 306.6 MPa
   • Deck stress (original): 486.1 MPa
   • Deck stress (updated, scaled): 348.8 MPa
   • Bulkhead bending stress: 273.7 MPa
   • Main bearing pressure: 57.4 MPa

   ✅ All pressure‑only stresses within material limits after deck thickening.

3. THERMAL ANALYSIS – CYLINDER WALL
   • Material conductivity: 150 W/(m·K)
   • Convection (water jacket): h = 8000 W/(m²·K)
   • Heat flux range examined: 1–20 MW/m²
   • Temperature drop across wall at 3 MW/m²: ≈0.1 K
   • Thermal stress at 3 MW/m²: ≈0.1 MPa
   • Combined von‑Mises stress (hoop + thermal): 306.6 MPa
   • Safety factor (0.9×yield = 452.7 MPa): 1.48

   ✅ Cylinder wall thickness sufficient; thermal effects negligible.

4. THERMAL ANALYSIS – DECK
   • Deck conduction resistance: 67.8 K/(W/mm²)
   • Convection resistance: 125.0 K/(W/mm²)
   • Temperature drop across deck at 3 MW/m²: ≈0.2 K
   • Thermal stress at 3 MW/m²: ≈0.3 MPa
   • Combined stress (original deck): 486.3 MPa → SF = 0.93 (UNSAFE)
   • Combined stress (updated deck, 12 mm): ≈349 MPa → SF = 1.30 (SAFE)

   ✅ After increasing deck thickness to 12 mm, deck survives typical heat fluxes.

5. CRITICAL HEAT FLUXES (σ_total = 452.7 MPa)
   • Cylinder wall: 8.33 W/mm² (8 GW/m²) – practically unlimited
   • Deck (original): already exceeds yield at zero heat flux
   • Deck (updated): 0.347 W/mm² (347 MW/m²) – far above typical combustion flux

6. DESIGN CHANGES APPLIED
   a) Increased deck thickness from 10.17 mm to 12.00 mm.
   b) Maintained cylinder wall thickness (4.87 mm) – adequate.
   c) Water‑jacket thickness unchanged (7.79 mm).
   d) All other dimensions unchanged.

7. ANSYS SIMULATION SETUP RECOMMENDATIONS
   • Geometry file: `cylinder_block_deck_12mm.step`
   • Material: 7075‑T6 aluminum (E = 71.7 GPa, ν = 0.33, α = 23 ppm/K, k = 150 W/(m·K))
   • Loads:
        - Pressure: 30 MPa uniform on cylinder walls (inner surface) and deck top.
        - Heat flux: 3 MW/m² (0.003 W/mm²) on combustion‑exposed surfaces (inner wall + deck).
        - Convection: h = 8000 W/(m²·K) on water‑jacket surfaces (coolant side, T_cool = 90 °C).
   • Boundary conditions:
        - Symmetry planes as appropriate (V‑bank symmetry).
        - Main bearing saddles fixed in all directions (simplified).
        - Deck top free to expand (or constrained by head studs – include head‑gasket contact if possible).
   • Element type: 3D coupled‑field solid (SOLID226/227) or separate thermal + structural.
   • Expected results:
        - Max von‑Mises stress <350 MPa (deck region).
        - Max temperature rise <50 K (inner wall ~140 °C).
        - Safety factor >1.3.

8. FILES PROVIDED
   • `cylinder_block_deck_12mm.step` – updated CAD geometry.
   • `cylinder_block_30MPa_7075_T6_updated.json` – updated design parameters.
   • `cylinder_block_thermal.py` – cylinder‑wall thermal analysis script.
   • `cylinder_block_deck_thermal.py` – deck thermal analysis script.

9. NOTES & CAVEATS
   • Analysis assumes 1D radial/linear heat transfer; 3D FEA will capture local hot spots.
   • Deck stress scaling uses simple bending formula; actual stress concentration near cylinder‑head bolt holes may increase stress.
   • Water‑jacket convection coefficient is estimated; actual coolant flow may yield higher h.
   • Thermal expansion of cylinder head relative to block may induce additional stresses (not accounted for).
   • For extreme durability, consider adding cooling passages near deck and using higher‑conductivity coating (plasma‑sprayed copper?).

============================================================================
CONCLUSION
============================================================================
The cylinder block is thermally feasible with a 12 mm deck thickness. Cylinder wall
thickness is adequate. The design is ready for detailed coupled thermo‑mechanical
FEA in Ansys to verify local stress concentrations and temperature distribution.
